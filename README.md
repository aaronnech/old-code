old-code
========

A repository of old high school / middle school coding projects on my hard drive. I will add to it as I find more projects that I can identify from that era.


History
=======

I started seriously coding in middle school when my parents gifted me a game programming book. I began writing primarily games in game-driven languages such as BlitzMax and Monkey before moving on to other things.

There will probably be some web stuff in there as well.


Code Quality
============

The code quality is terrible, and I don't recommend anyone use it for anything.
